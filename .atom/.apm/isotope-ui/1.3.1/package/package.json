One Atom, many Isotopes ;) Isotope bases its colors on the selected syntax theme and blends with all of them.\n\nIt's intended to provide an easy-on-the-eyes backdrop for your code, with well balanced typography, whitespace and contrast.\n\nThanks to [@simurai](https://github.com/simurai) for the work on the [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) theme that Isotope was forked from.\n\n![flat background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/flat.png)\n\n![gradient background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/gradient.png)\n\n![image background](https://github.com/braver/isotope-ui/raw/master/resources/images/image.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- Automatically adapts to your favourite syntax theme\n- Tweaks [minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap), [color-highlight](https://atom.io/packages/atom-color-highlight), [web-browser](https://atom.io/packages/web-browser) (more to come)\n- Looks awesome in [Distraction free mode](https://atom.io/packages/distraction-free-mode)\n- Configurable!\n\n\n## Configuration\n\n**You may need to reload atom before settings become available ([settings-view #347](https://github.com/atom/settings-view/issues/347))**\n\n- Choose from a number of fonts included in this theme, or match the editor's font.\n- Select hip 'thin' fonts, or trusty old 'regular'.\n- Choose between a flat or gradient background.\n- Or even use any image as background (from your computer or [the internets](http://hubblesite.org)).\n- Choose tree-view highlight color.\n- Choose low contrast tooltips (or fancy colorful ones).\n- Change font-sizes for the entire UI (everything will scale to fit) by putting this in your stylesheet:\n\n```\nhtml, body { font-size: 9px; }\n```\n\n\n## Fonts\n\nThis package includes a number of fonts that were designed especially for user interfaces.
